#Main.py
#This is an evolutionary algorithm to solve the following problem: 
#Given a 3-dimensional graph, consisting of X,Y,and Z. Where X, and Y are co-ordinates on a map, and Z is some value, place a series of n circles on the map such that:
#1. The sum of the Z value of the integer-points enclosed within the circles is maximised.
#2. Each point can only be counted once.
#In this instance, it relates to placing EV Charging stations on a real world map, where Z value represents traffic within that area. The question is, what is the most efficient placement of these stations given a limited budget.
